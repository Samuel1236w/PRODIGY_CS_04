OVERVIEW 

This project demonstrates a basic keylogger implemented in Python using the pynput library. The keylogger captures and logs keystrokes, saving them to a text file with timestamps. This script is designed for educational purposes to show how keypress events can be captured programmatically.

FEATURES

	•	Logs each key pressed, including special keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Space).
	•	Saves keypress logs with timestamps in a file (keylog.txt).
	•	Stops logging when the Esc key is pressed.
