OVERVIEW 

This project demonstrates a basic keylogger implemented in Python using the pynput library. The keylogger captures and logs keystrokes, saving them to a text file with timestamps. This script is designed for educational purposes to show how keypress events can be captured programmatically.

FEATURES

  - Logs each key pressed, including special keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Space).
  - Saves keypress logs with timestamps in a file (keylog.txt).
  - Stops logging when the Esc key is pressed.

SETUP

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You will also need to install the pynput library, which is used to listen to keyboard events.
   - Install Python (if not already installed):
   - Download and install Python from python.org.
   - Install Required Libraries:
   - Install the pynput library using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
       - pip install pynput

RUNNING THE KEYLOGGER

  1. Download the Script:
Clone this repository or download the keylogger.py file.
  2. Run the Script:
Open a terminal/command prompt in the directory where the script is located, and run:

    python keylogger.py

LOGGING KEYSTROKES 
  - The script will start logging your keystrokes in the keylog.txt file.
  - Press the Esc key to stop the keylogger.

Important Ethical Considerations

	•	Educational Use Only: This script is intended for educational purposes only to demonstrate how keypress events can be captured using Python.
	•	Permission: Never use this script without explicit permission from the individuals whose keystrokes are being logged.
	•	Legal Warning: Unauthorized keylogging can violate privacy rights and is illegal in many jurisdictions. Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security.
	•	Responsible Use: Always be transparent about your intentions and ensure that the users involved fully understand what the software does and consent to its usage.
